To regeneate the source, run the following commands in the `ext` directory.
This is not needed to build the source.

git clone https://github.com/vlm/asn1c.git
cd asn1c
autoreconf -iv
./configure
make
cd ..
asn1c/asn1c/asn1c -S asn1c/skeletons -pdu=all -pdu=Certificate -fwide-types asn1/*.asn1
rm converter-sample.c

git clone https://github.com/cr-marcstevens/sha1collisiondetection.git
cp sha1collisiondetection/lib/* .

# RFC3280 has a Time type which will cause the compiler to create a Time.h
# file. This will conflict with <time.h> on a case insensitive filesystem.
# We work around this problem with this hack:
 
mv Time.h TTime.h
perl -pi -e 's/"Time.h"/"TTime.h"/g' *.*
