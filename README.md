# certlint
X.509 certificate linter

certlint is currently at version 0.1.0.  It does not yet build as a gem.  For now, execute by running:

`ruby -I lib bin/certlint` or `ruby -I lib bin/cablint`

## Required gems

* public_suffix
* open4
* simpleidn

If using less than Ruby 2.3, you also need the `unf` gem.

## Building certlint-x509helper

certlint requires that the program certlint-x509helper be in your path and executable.

See build-x509helper/README for instructions on building it.

## Output

Messages will be output one per line.  Each line will start with a single capital letter, a colon, and a space. The letters indicate the type of message:

B: Bug. Your certificate has a feature not handled by certlint.
I: Information.  These are purely informational; no action is needed.
N: Notice.  These are items known to cause issues with one or more implementations of certificate processing but are not errors according to the standard.
W: Warning.  These are issues where a standard recommends differently but the standard uses terms such as "SHOULD" or "MAY".
E: Error.  These are issues where the certificate is not compliant with the standard.
F: Fatal Error.  These errors are fatal to the checks and prevent most further checks from being executed.  These are extremely bad errors.
